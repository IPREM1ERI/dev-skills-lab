Hereâ€™s a great flow to follow when you want to add functionality to your web app:
1. Identify the proper Route (Verb + Path)
2. Create the UI that issues a request that matches that route.
3. Define the route on the server and map it to a controller action.
4. Code and export the controller action.
5. `res.render` a view in the case of a `GET` request, or `res.redirect` if data was changed. Write the view template if it does not already exist.
